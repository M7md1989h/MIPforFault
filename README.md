# README

This repository is for the replication of our paper Mixed Integer Programming Formulation for Fault Identification based on MicroPMUs.
Files description:

1- 'mipforfualt.m' : is the matlab code (Mixed Integer Programming Formulation). it tests each bus in the feeder for single, double and three phase fault.

2- 'ieee37.DSS, Run_IEEE123Bus.DSS and 134.DSS' are th OpenDSS main files.

3- 'P.mat' is microPMUs placment file.


# Testing Requirements
To run all the codes succeesfully you need to have CVX (Mosek,Gorubi) and OpenDSS.

# Citation is required
If you find this code useful for your research, please cite
